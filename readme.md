## Install

```bash
npm install doubly
```

## Usage

Doubly exposes a progressive and serializable API, that can be utilized through a simple and minimal syntax, allowing you to combine and chain methods effectively.

Usage examples can be also found at the [`test`](https://github.com/klauscfhq/doubly/tree/master/test) directory.

## In Depth

### Linear Doubly Linked List

### Circular Doubly Linked List

## API

The following documentation holds for both circular & linear lists. The described `list` instance is used to depict the same methods that are applicable to both a linear and a circular linked list, without overlooking their above described differences and unique qualities.
